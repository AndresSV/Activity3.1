Using cordova / react native / flutter create an app with the following behaviour:

- The app starts and shows a button with the text "LOAD" and an empty recyclerview

- When the user presses LOAD the app starts a request to retrieve a JSON from a remote location.

- The JSON must populate the listview with one friend per space.

- Each row in the list view must be a custom layout that includes name of the friend and favorite hobby

- When the user clicks on any element in the list a new view is shown. This view displays text regarding the friend: name, hobby, age, phone and address.
